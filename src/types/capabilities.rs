///
/// A list of capabilities that the server supports.
/// The capability list will include the atom "IMAP4rev1".
///
/// In addition, all servers implement the `STARTTLS`, `LOGINDISABLED`, and `AUTH=PLAIN` (described
/// in [IMAP-TLS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2595)) capabilities. See the [Security
/// Considerations section of the RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501#section-11) for
/// important information.
///
/// A capability name which begins with `AUTH=` indicates that the server supports that particular
/// authentication mechanism.
///
/// The `LOGINDISABLED` capability indicates that the `LOGIN` command is disabled, and that the
/// server will respond with a [`super::Error::No`] response to any attempt to use the `LOGIN`
/// command even if the user name and password are valid.  An IMAP client MUST NOT issue the
/// `LOGIN` command if the server advertises the `LOGINDISABLED` capability.
///
/// Other capability names indicate that the server supports an extension, revision, or amendment
/// to the IMAP4rev1 protocol. Capability names either begin with `X` or they are standard or
/// standards-track [RFC 3501](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501) extensions, revisions, or
/// amendments registered with IANA.
///
/// Client implementations SHOULD NOT require any capability name other than `IMAP4rev1`, and MUST
/// ignore any unknown capability names.
